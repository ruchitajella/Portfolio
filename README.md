# üöÄ Ruchitanjani Jella | Personal Portfolio Website
This is the source code for my personal developer portfolio, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and educational background in a clean, modern, and responsive user interface.

The entire application is built as a single-page application (SPA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, prioritizing performance and accessibility.

## ‚ú® Features
* **Fixed Navigation:** A fixed header navigation bar ensures easy access to all sections (Home, Skills, Projects, Education, Contact) regardless of scroll position.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented using JavaScript to provide a seamless transition between sections for enhanced user experience.
* **Dynamic Resume Button:** A "View Resume" button is fixed to the corner and dynamically fades in and out based on scroll position, making the call-to-action prominent without being distracting.
* **Contact Form Validation:** Includes basic client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure required fields are filled before submission.
* **Dark Theme:** Features a professional, dark background theme with bold red/pink accents (`rgb(240, 70, 70)`) for highlight elements.

## üì± Fully Responsive Design
This portfolio is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

* **Flexible Layouts:** Sections like Education and Contact automatically transition from a horizontal (desktop) layout to a vertical (mobile) stack using CSS Media Queries.
* **Adaptive Elements:** The "View Resume" button shrinks in size on smaller mobile screens to prevent screen obstruction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the core structure and semantic content.
* **CSS3:** For styling, custom animations, and responsive design (using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries).
* **JavaScript:** For interactivity, smooth scrolling, and basic form handling.
